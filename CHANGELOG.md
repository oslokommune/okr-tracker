# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [UNRELEASED]

### Added

- A new timeline view for objectives has been added (visualized in a Gantt
  chart).
- A separate list view has been added to the measurements tab.

### Changed

- The OKR period selection tabs have been moved into a drop down menu in the top
  bar matching the period selector on the KPI page.
- Improved OKR overview page styling.
- Improved tooltip styling.
- All forms now use Punkt-styled input fields.
- Y-axes in measurement graphs now start counting from zero by default. It's
  possible to revert individual measurements to the old behavior of starting the
  y-axis around the lowest measured value in the measurement admin settings.
- The change within a selected period (first and latest progress value) is now
  displayed beneath the progress graph for measurements.

### Fixed

- Fixed rendering of charts containing goals with missing value.
- Fixed a bug in the measurement goal value input field.
- The period selector dropdown menu has been made more responsive.
- The key result progression update form is now cleared on submit to prevent
  double submission.
- Top bar content centering has been fixed on public pages.

## [3.5.0] 2023-04-03

### Added

- Added mini graphs to KPI cards.
- A new site admin API for updating user details has been added.

### Changed

- The period selector is moved to a more prominent position in the item tab bar.
  It also includes two more pre-defined periods: current and previous quarter.
- The API endpoints for updating key result and KPI progression values now
  accept an optional `comment` parameter.
- The measurements tab has been redesigned and now integrates the previous
  measurement details page. This in order to provide an improved overview of all
  measurements.
- Upgraded from Vue 2.6 to 2.7.

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug that caused KPI trend indicators to be displayed in inverse.
- The date picker on the KPI details page no longer disappears when the selected
  period doesn't contain any measurements.
- The admin link is no longer displayed in the item tab bar for users without
  edit rights.
- The item tab bar is now more responsive.

## [3.4.0] 2023-03-03

### Changed

- The admin link on the OKR page has been removed and is replaced by a separate
  tab in the item tab bar.
- Tag to indicate trend has been added to all KPI cards.
- The layout of most pages are now more unified. Some widgets previously found
  in the sidebars of each page has been removed and their contents moved
  elsewhere.
- The period selector now affects all measurements under the "Measurements" tab.
  It is also moved outside the result indicator box.
- Custom alerts have been replaced by the equivalent component from the [Punkt
  design system](https://punkt.oslo.kommune.no/latest/komponenter/alert/index).
- The page scroll manipulation when administrating measurements have been
  somewhat relaxed. When viewing details of a specific measurement, the admin
  tab now also links directly to the measurement in question.

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where document references in a KPI document would be overwritten
  by resolved document data. This also includes a fix to the API which would
  fail while attempting to resolve these invalid document references.
- The state of an opened measurement edit form is now kept as is, even if the
  document has been updated in the background (e.g. while setting goals). This
  also prevents other data fields of the document, that might have been updated
  separately, from being overwritten with outdated data when saving the form
  (e.g. cached progress and goals).
- When deleting a user, all references to the user are now also removed from
  organization and department member lists, like it is for products.
- Date pickers used throughout the app now respect the selected language and
  are translated accordingly.

## [3.3.0] 2023-02-03

### Added

- A tab bar has been added to the main item view (organization, department,
  product) to facilitate easier navigation between relevant sections: OKRs,
  measurements (previously called "Dashboard") and general about information.
- Tooltips are now also enabled for values and comments in the key result
  line chart.

### Changed

- All custom icon components are now replaced by counterparts from the [Punkt
  design system](https://punkt.oslo.kommune.no/latest/profil/ikoner/index).
- KPIs are now generally called "measurements" in the app. The different types
  of KPIs are kept as respectively "result indicators", "key figures" and
  (plain) "measurements".
- Any currently active period is now focused by default, instead of most
  recent, when visiting the OKR view.
- Progress bar styling has been improved for better differentiation between the
  empty and filled state.
- Dates in the period selector for measurements are now formatted to a more
  natural language in order to increase readability.
- In order to be more Punkt-compliant, the line chart area filler is no longer
  a gradient. It is instead replaced by a an opaque version of the current
  value line color.

### Removed

- Support for cookie based authentication has been removed from our APIs.

### Fixed

- Period progression is now updated when an objective is moved between periods.
- Fixed a bug causing text to sometimes overflow in tooltips and progress
  history tables.
- Fixed a bug where the key result details view in some cases would display
  the incorrect (parent) period if visited directly.
- The y axis of the key result progress graph now adapts to values outside its
  defined range instead of drawing outside the visible graph area.
- Fixed a bug in how error responses were returned from the access request API.

### Security

- Restricted the accept and delete endpoints in the request access API to ensure
  super admin status.

## [3.2.0] 2023-01-16

### Added

- A green checkmark icon is shown beneath the dashboard result indicator graph
  when the current goal has been reached within the period.

### Changed

- Google Sheets integrations now expect full Google Sheets URLs instead of the
  sheet IDs.
- Node 16 is now the default runtime for all Cloud Functions and when running
  the app locally.
- More informative error page views.
- Added contextual link to API documentation below curl example.
- Statistics shown beneath the dashboard result indicator graph (latest value
  and goal) now reflects the selected period.

### Removed

- The green color theme has been removed. It hasn't received much love lately,
  and our focus will rather be to better align the default blue theme with the
  Punkt design system going forward.
- Removed built-in Google Analytics integration. It was just default settings.
  Will probably be replaced by some other analytics tool once we select one
  that is compliant.

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where saving a placeholder OKR period without changes would result
  in it being set to unix epoch.
- Fixed an incorrect admin rights check in the team widget.
- Charts now support displaying a single measurement.

## [3.1.0] 2022-12-15

### Changed

- The result indicator graph now defaults to showing all registered measurements
  in the dashboard.
- Values for key result progress are now rounded to maximum two decimal places
  when displayed.
- Renamed the heading and admin tab for "KPIs" to "measurements".
- The graphs trend tag does now differ on display type 'integer' and 'percentage'
  when displaying the increase/decrease for period.
- Current goals are now listed on the KPI admin page.
- Line chart tooltips have been redesigned.
- Usability improvements in the goal editing modal dialogue.
- Form validation improvements by displaying more detailed user feedback and
  preventing submit on form errors.

### Removed

- Removed the (unused) icon option field from the OKR objective edit menu.

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where the right column on department pages would be hidden
  unintentionally.
- Fixed a bug where line charts would sometimes be rendered without goal lines.
- Added a missing Firestore index to make the admin feasibly fast again.

### Security

- Fixed a vulnerability regarding encoding of query strings to Firestore.

## [3.0.0] 2022-11-25

This release comprises nearly half a year of work and marks a change in how
development and releases will be handled onward.

The previous `master`, `develop`, and long lived feature branches are scrapped
in favor of a trunk based development workflow on the new `main` branch. From
here we will run continuous deployments toward our own instance of the OKR
Tracker, and strive to make new releases more frequently than before.

### Added

- The biggest change in this release is the new dashboard which is available for
  departments, displaying a summaries of their missions, target groups,
  products, KPI- and OKR statuses. The dashboard is reached from the "Dashboard"
  link in the right column on a department's front page.
- The update frequency, preferred trend, and type of a KPI can now be declared.
- New API endpoints have been added for listing, updating, and deleting KPI
  progression values.
- Added the ability to create, update, and delete progression values in the
  admin interface.
- Comments can now be added to measurements.
- Goals can now be set for KPIs.
- The curl command example can now be copied by using a button.

  exist on a single day, only the last measurement is taken into account.
- Improved number shortening/formatting.
- The KPI grid is made more compact and more responsive.
- The KPI admin page uses collapsible panels.
- The home page styling has been changed to accommodate displaying an arbitrary
  number of KPIs.
- More flexible team member listing – all roles can now be owned by more than
  one team member.
- KPIs can be updated by a Google Sheet integration and via the API
  simultaneously.
- Line chart styling and usability has been improved.
- The admin link section has been simplified by removing the shortcuts and
  having a single large link to the admin page instead.

### Removed

- Removed the previous dashboard view and all related code.
- Removed API endpoint returning the current user's authentication token.

### Fixed

- Various text and translation fixes.
- Fixed a display bug for radio buttons.

## [2.7.0] 2021-12-29

OKR-tracker has been redesigned!

We have been working tirelessly for the last couple of months to give you a new design. We have tried to make it more robust, better UX for our users and a better navigation. Some information has been lifted, to give the user better information for their objectives and key results, and easier to update them respectively.

### Added

- Redesign: new design in all the right places. Giving the users a better way of showing the Objectives and Key Results
- Content Loaders! We have added content loaders to some of our components and hopefully this will increase the UX for our users
- Side menu has been changed to a drawer

### Changes

## [2.6.1] 2021-11-10

### Fixed

- Small bug with the public api after the big rewrite of Cloud Functions to ES Modules

## [2.6.0] 2021-11-09

Last minor update before releasing our new design. New updates from now on will only be small bug fixes.

### Changes

## [2.5.3] 2021-10-27

### Fixed

- KPI graph did not show if one progress object had a value equal to 0

## [2.5.2] 2021-10-19

### Changes

- Removed sass-variables for colors, using CSS Variables instead
- Updated README with more information when deploying to prod for the first time
- Updated dependencies

## [2.5.0] 2021-10-14

We have added another slackbot integration. The new slackbot integration pushes changes to organizations/departments/products.

You can call the slack bot with the command `/okr`. The different commands to the slack bot are:

- `subscribe organization/department/product slug` - subscribe to a specific org/dep/prod
- `unsubscribe organization/department/product slug` - unsubscribe
- `subscribe/all organization/department slug` - subscribe to a specific org/dep/prod and all its children (departments/products)
- `unsubscribe/all organization/department slug` - unsubscribe to everything

What types of updates does the bot push?
Changes to the:

- name
- mission statement

Creation of:

- Objectives
- Key Results

Caveats:

- If you run subscribe/all once on an organization/department and create a new product after that
  - run subscribe/all again, because we don't add new children to the parent subscription

## Added

- Slack bot integration with channels in your slack organization. Push updates to a slack channel. (Read the readme about the changes and how to implement it)

Example:
`/okr subscribe product dataspeilet`

Now we would get updates to our slack channel with changes to our product, dataspeilet. (Mountain Peach is the name of our test user)

### Removed

- Removed keycloak integration

## [2.3.1] 2021-09-28

### Fixed

- Normal team members were not actually allowed to update their own organization/department/product

## [2.3.0] 2021-09-28

We have added another lever of admin, called super admin. We are sorry, but you need to update some database documents to make this work.

Super Admin can:

- do the same things as an admin and normal member
- restore backups
- promote or demote admins
- migrate data
- create/restore/change organizations

Admins can:

- do the same things as a member
- add new users to the OKR-tracker
- administrate an organization they are apart of
- administrate multiple products within the same organization
- administrate multiple departments within the same organization

Member of a product or department or organization

- has rights to administrate its own product/org/departments
- ... such as add/remove members from a product/org/department
  - or update/delete/archive

### BREAKING CHANGES

- Added another lever of admin - super admin.
  - Add superAdmin-property to one user, and then that person can give others superAdmin-access
  - Super admin needs to go and update every single product/department/organization to support the new RBAC system (sorry for the inconvenience)

### Fixed

- Users were not allowed to archive its own product or department

## [2.2.1] 2021-09-23

- Updated dependencies
- Removed redundant firebase config environment keys
- Updated readme for a better understanding of firebase private keys

### Removed

- Removed sass-loader because we don't use webpack anymore

## [2.1.2] 2021-09-02

### Fixed

## [2.1.1] 2021-08-31

### Changes

- Tab title changes together with the navbar title

## [2.1.0] 2021-08-30

We have removed vue-cli and moved to vitejs for better develop experience and faster build and deploy times. This also means that from now on that we won't support IE11 at all. The chance that IE11 shows only a white screen is highly possible. We only support evergreen/modern browsers

### Added

### Changes

- Moved from vue-cli to vitejs for our frontend build tool 🎉⚡🔥 Better, faster and leaner developer experience 🎉⚡🔥
- Removed collapse-icon if the item has no children

## [2.0.1] 2021-08-25

### Changes

- Sort KeyResults when in ObjectiveHome-view
- Removed some unnecessary code duplication
- Updated dependencies

## [2.0.0] 2021-08-23

We've decided to release v2 out of RC after almost a year of updates. We feel like the code is stable enough to warrant a v2 release. We haven't managed to develop all the features that we wanted, but we have already been working on a redesign for v2.1 for a couple of months now.

Our next steps are continuing to rewrite the way data is written to the database, move more and more out to a better API and hopefully open up our APIs to our users. And to look at a more robust RBAC with different levels.

See [release notes](./documentation/release-notes_v2.0.0.md).

### Added

## [1.1.0] - 2020-03-09

This release introduces _dynamic date periods_ that replace static annual quarters for objectives. This means that custom date periods need to be manually created on each department and product onwards.

Under the ‘Danger Zone’ section on the admin view there is an action that automates the convertion of currently existing objecties onto dyamic date periods. This should only be triggered **once** in production after release of this version to prevent data loss.

This change adds a `/periods` subcollection on the `departments` and `products` collections that holds the details for the periods as well as the _progression_ for that period.

### Added

- Show callout to team members when a product image is missing
- Documentation for managing departments on Help page
- Automated backup of the firebase database
- Automated restore of backup for the firebase database

### Changed

- Converting static annual quarters to dynamic and custom date periods
  - Users can now create unlimited future (and past) periods
  - Users must give name date periods
  - Navigating between periods using URL query parameters
  - Adjustments in Cloud Functions to handle progression for dynamic periods
- Refactoring some Firestore handling – introducing the `serializeList` function to make the codebase a bit more DRY.
- Hide progress visualisation when department or product does not have any objectives

### Removed

- Legacy dashboard component

### Fixed

- Fix issue where progress graphic did not always update when navigating between pages
- Force the submenu to appear even when no periods are available
- Minor layout adjustment on the page header (less white space below page name on desktop)
- Allow floating point numbers as key result progress
- Replace _ninjas_ with _cubes_ when a department has zero products
