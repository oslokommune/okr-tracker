## [2.5.3] 2021-10-27

### Fixed

## [2.5.2] 2021-10-19

### Fixed

## [2.5.0] 2021-10-14

We have added another slackbot integration. The new slackbot integration pushes changes to organizations/departments/products.

You can call the slack bot with the command `/okr`. The different commands to the slack bot are:
- `subscribe organization/department/product slug` - subscribe to a specific org/dep/prod
- `unsubscribe organization/department/product slug` - unsubscribe
- `subscribe/all organization/department slug` - subscribe to a specific org/dep/prod and all its children (departments/products)
- `unsubscribe/all organization/department slug` - unsubscribe to everything

What types of updates does the bot push?
Changes to the:
- name
- mission statement

Creation of:
- Objectives
- Key Results

Caveats:
- If you run subscribe/all once on an organization/department and create a new product after that
  - run subscribe/all again, because we don't add new children to the parent subscription

## Added

- Slack bot integration with channels in your slack organization. Push updates to a slack channel. (Read the readme about the changes and how to implement it)

Example:
`/okr subscribe product dataspeilet`

Now we would get updates to our slack channel with changes to our product, dataspeilet. (Mountain Peach is the name of our test user)

## Changes

- Save-buttons are disabled until changes have been made.

- KeyResultHome: moved widgets around for easier access to the edit button
- Updated dependencies

## [2.4.1] 2021-10-05

### Added

- Log in with Microsoft (Thank you, @knowit, for the changes)

### Removed

- Removed keycloak integration

## [2.3.1] 2021-09-28

### Fixed

- Normal team members were not actually allowed to update their own organization/department/product

## [2.3.0] 2021-09-28

We have added another lever of admin, called super admin. We are sorry, but you need to update some database documents to make this work.

Super Admin can:
- do the same things as an admin and normal member
- restore backups
- promote or demote admins
- migrate data
- create/restore/change organizations

Admins can:
- do the same things as a member
- add new users to the OKR-tracker
- administrate an organization they are apart of
- administrate multiple products within the same organization
- administrate multiple departments within the same organization

Member of a product or department or organization
- has rights to administrate its own product/org/departments
- ... such as add/remove members from a product/org/department
  - or update/delete/archive

### BREAKING CHANGES

- Added another lever of admin - super admin.
  - Add superAdmin-property to one user, and then that person can give others superAdmin-access
  - Super admin needs to go and update every single product/department/organization to support the new RBAC system (sorry for the inconvenience)

### Fixed

- Users were not allowed to archive its own product or department

## [2.2.1] 2021-09-23

### Added

- Job positions: added Storyteller

### Fixed

- i18n corrections
- Dashboard: PieChart not rendering correctly

## [2.2.0] 2021-09-14

- PieChart follows color scheme

### Changes

- Styles
- TeamWidget: Multiple job positions are grouped into a parent position, i.e.: backend-, frontend-, mobile-, hardware-developers are grouped into `Developers`
- Updated dependencies
- Removed redundant firebase config environment keys
- Updated readme for a better understanding of firebase private keys

### Removed

- Removed sass-loader because we don't use webpack anymore

## [2.1.2] 2021-09-02

## [2.1.1] 2021-08-31

### Changes

- Tab title changes together with the navbar title

## [2.1.0] 2021-08-30

We have removed vue-cli and moved to vitejs for better develop experience and faster build and deploy times. This also means that from now on that we won't support IE11 at all. The chance that IE11 shows only a white screen is highly possible. We only support evergreen/modern browsers

### Added

- Use Firebase auth emulator to emulate authentication (only for developers)

### Changes

- Moved from vue-cli to vitejs for our frontend build tool ðŸŽ‰âš¡ðŸ”¥ Better, faster and leaner developer experience ðŸŽ‰âš¡ðŸ”¥

## [2.0.1] 2021-08-25

### Changes

- Sort KeyResults when in ObjectiveHome-view
- Removed some unnecessary code duplication
- Updated dependencies

## [2.0.0] 2021-08-23

We've decided to release v2 out of RC after almost a year of updates. We feel like the code is stable enough to warrant a v2 release. We haven't managed to develop all the features that we wanted, but we have already been working on a redesign for v2.1 for a couple of months now.

Our next steps are continuing to rewrite the way data is written to the database, move more and more out to a better API and hopefully open up our APIs to our users. And to look at a more robust RBAC with different levels.

See [release notes](./documentation/release-notes_v2.0.0.md).

### Added

- Add team members to Organizations and Departments to offload admin access

## [2.0.0-rc.10] 2021-04-27

We are looking at doing some design changes to the Objective/KeyRes-view, which means that some changes need to be made beforehand. We have therefore implemented a Theme Toggle! You can now toggle between Blue, Yellow and Green color themes.

### Added

  - Switch color theme at the bottom of the sidebar or in the user-menu in the top right corner

- Key Result: Show curl-example if you toggle the option "update via API"

- KPIHome: format all values to correct format. Instead of floats -> format to percentage
- Better OpenSpec and API-gateway support.
- Moved API-KEY for Gateway from query-param to header

### Fixed

- CF/API: save progress (KPI/KeyRes) as a number and not a string
- CF/API: Fixed a bug with the KeyRes GET return two responses on the same GET-call which caused the API to crash

## [2.0.0-rc.7] 2021-03-23

### Added

- Cloud Functions: CRUD API for KPI and Key Results. It is now possible to call an end point if you want to update progress through the API and not through the frontend. Locked behind API Gateway with API key, get in contact to get a key.

## [2.0.0-rc.6] 2021-03-17

OKR-tracker will get out of beta/RC by the end of June 2021. It has been in a beta-state for quite some time now, and we feel it has matured enough for a full release. This does not mean we will stop working on it, since we do have some milestones we would like to hit.

### Fixed

## [1.1.0] - 2020-03-09

This release introduces _dynamic date periods_ that replace static annual quarters for objectives. This means that custom date periods need to be manually created on each department and product onwards.

Under the â€˜Danger Zoneâ€™ section on the admin view there is an action that automates the convertion of currently existing objecties onto dyamic date periods. This should only be triggered **once** in production after release of this version to prevent data loss.

This change adds a `/periods` subcollection on the `departments` and `products` collections that holds the details for the periods as well as the _progression_ for that period.

### Added
